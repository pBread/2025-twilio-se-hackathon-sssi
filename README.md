### Sync Service

- Add select or create a Sync Service to the demo UI

### Update Table to Show Multiple Invocation Requests

### Add Summarization

- Update the call with a period summarization.

### integrate the segment interaction history

- Pull the previous conversations of this user and provide them to the bot.

### Fix the selectors issue by including the fetch state in a reselect selector
